Research Topics
======

My prior research fields included <span style="color: #33A1C9;">**Inclusive Finance, E-commerce, and Entrepreneurship**</span>. I explored the relationship between risk preferences and rural households' entrepreneurial behavior in my undergraduate dissertation. According to a six-year follow-up survey of 6468 rural Chinese households, the analysis shows that rural households with high risk appetite are more likely to make entrepreneurial choices, and a developed financial environment in rural areas is more likely to stimulate farm households' willingness to start a business. 

My current research interests are focused on <span style="color: #33A1C9;">**Social Media, Online Trust and HCI**</span>. Specially, how ICTs and STSs can help people form online trust and enhance well-being, with a focus on vulnerable and marginalized populations. For instance, the shifting in the trust of information consumers and information producers on e-commerce platforms, the crisis of trust they showed on social media during the Covid-19, and the discrimination of trust in P2P platforms,etc. I have built a multi-modal framework to analysis online trust problem of both parties in the crowdfunding platform transaction, which using text, video, and audio, and independently collected an augmented data set for training to achieve antecedent predictions for crowdfunding results. Besides, I also focus on Health Informatics and Trustworthy AI. For example, the orderly's acceptance and use of health information technology and how to build an efficient and reliable health care platform. 

⚽️ Apart from scientific research, I am also highly interested in youth training and tactics of football. I believe that teenagers are adorable, energetic, and talented. They are the future.
